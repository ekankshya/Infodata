								<span class="image main"><img src="images/alpha.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>A self-motivated visual communicator with a hunger for taking on challenges to the point where skills match my level of curiosity, and beyond that, it’s on autopilot. I have an academic interest in interactive spatial design, psychology and aesthetics; the most relevant confluence of these prospects directed me to interaction design. I draw inspiration from popular culture, history, sci-fi and enjoy leading projects. An underlying bias towards visual design and my compulsive nature of upgrading my knowledge opens gates for unique blends of the design specialisations.</a>.</p>

								<h2 class="major">cRITIQUE</h2>
								<h4>Refer to the article using this <a href="https://pudding.cool/2018/07/women-in-congress/">link </a> </h4>
								<p></p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/bla.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h4>Data & Abstractions: Choice of data for the story & selection of the insight abstractions:</h4>
								<p>The conversation on ‘Gender Parity’ as clearly mentioned in the very heading of the article, has been showcased via the lens of representation through the years. While bringing to the surface the change in representation over the years, I personally feel the intent of the unequal representation has been made a little obscure. The headline makes it appear like we have reached the optimal level and there is no more progress to be made. 

									The choice of key representation by the Republican and the Democratic party the leading fronts of the political scene in the USA; delivers the idea of how the ‘House of Representatives functions. There has also been the depiction of how gender parity changed in a set of other countries, while it gives a good comparative study, I personally feel the context is lost without a brief description of why and how these trends have changed. I feel that a little background about the socio-political and cultural landscape in the country and build association with the relevant data for better context and cohesive cognition.</p>
									<h4>Visuals & Representations: Choice of appropriate visuals and data representations:</h4>
								<p>The article has referred to the active term of the candidates to denote the first representation on the page. With the very fact that every data point is a visualization of an individual, the article would have been counter-intuitive if they would have used a cumulative sum rather than individually denoting every woman who has served in Congress. They have done a great job at drawing an appropriate parallel between the conceptual intention of the available data and its visceral counterpart while concisely expressing the changing trends in the representation of women over the years. The choice of representation also decodes the term served visually alongside the proportion of the two parties, creating a clear contrast of parliamentary oppositions and their chosen representatives in their elected period respectively. The overlay of representing the presidential term builds a clear storyline that narrates the chronology to a certain extent but it takes a while to understand for someone who is not familiar with the ‘House of Representatives, USA’. The representation of the time spend on various facets of a functioning economy helps draw inferences about the perspective of women in power and gives stark imagery of the same. They further added a relatively more comprehensible visualisation using area plots and stacked bar graphs to make sure the message is not lost in the process, The data viewed in its entirety serves as a concise yet extendable version of the topic and hand.</p>
								<h4>Framing & Transition: Choice of framing the representations & transitioning across frames:</h4>
								<p>The article is using a dark theme which has gained a lot of traction due to it’s trending usage on the internet. This also serves as a great canvas for building clear and contrasting narrativ es by using party-specific colours for representation. A lot of clarity in the representation ahs beeen achieved by staging and animation. The markers used are familiar to the audience but the reader needs to interact with the elements to make sense of the represented data. ‘Scrollytelling’ has used the scroll interaction to animate content for esy grasping capabilities. While understanding the reactive content flow to to the scrolling speed might be a learning curve, most of the interactions are intuitive. Use of colour has been done intelliegently and emphasis has been generated by scalling and color contrast. It is an experience to read the article in itself, providing a sufficient amount of aesthetic value for the same.</p>
								<h4>Aesthetics & Design: Choice of aesthetics for the visuals & design elements for the story:</h4>
								<p>The dark background serves well for the eyes and the smart usage of colour has very well bonded the entire presentation together, it also made a lot of difference to the idea of represenation wherein an interesting contrast between the dot representation along with the actual metaphor in the real world has really communicated the idea. The transitioning frames make it easier to derive meaning out of the entire scheme of storytelling. The font size used is readable on an average-sized device and can even serve well for a mobile display, while the hover function cannot be accessed using mobile screens. The equality line has been represented on multiple occasions to create a comparative study of every aspect that is being introduced to us. The use of gestalt principles and contrasting colours has helped create very distinct layers of hierarchy in the content at hand. </p>
								<h4>Messaging & Annotation: Choice of verbal messaging & text annotation to tell the story:</h4>
								<p>An individual's term is represented on the time access with easy access to scroll and know more about them. While they have shared the district served, party and tenure a little more background information would have been handy to help a reader who is keen to know more and make more out of the information shared. Also making more sense of the context to understand what were the rights of women in the particular period in the USA, to make sense of the changing numbers in representation would have served a dual purpose- the changing rights of women proportional to their representation in the ‘House of Representatives’.  </p>
								<h4>Flow & Coherence: Choice of the flow of the narrative & coherence of the plot:</h4>
								<p>The Flow has been achieved by the animation and scrolling linked to the navigation behaviour of users engaged in reading on the web. It seems to serve people who are not used to long-form reading and need to be engaged throughout the reading experience. The article has managed to build a cohesive flow and introduces topics in a palatable fashion but at the same time, the relevance of the gap has not been backed by the context of the socio-political, cultural and economic impacts that might have dwelled in the background of the key narrative.</p>
								<h4>Interaction & Engagement: Choice of interaction elements & engaging the audience</h4>
								<p>The overlay of representing the presidential term builds a clear storyline that narrates the chronology to a certain extent but it takes a while to understand for someone who is not familiar with the ‘House of Representatives, USA’. The representation of the time spend on various facets of a functioning economy helps draw inferences about the perspective of women in power and gives stark imagery of the same. They further added a relatively more comprehensible visualisation using area plots and stacked bar graphs to make sure the message is not lost in the process, The data viewed in its entirety serves as a concise yet extendable version of the topic and hand.</p>
